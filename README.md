This project was built for Udemy course "Modern React Bootcamp" and was bootstrapped with create-react-app.

This is a responsive React application that allows a user to browse pre-generated color palettes or to create their own for future use. I've found this to be particularly useful in choosing hex colors to save for my own web projects. 

<ul> React Colors App uses the following tools: <br>
  <li>React and React Router</li>
  <li>Material UI</li>
  <li>JSS and withStyles</li>
  <li>Draggable color boxes</li>
  <li>Custom color picker</li>
  <li>Form validation</li>
  <li>SVG background</li>
</ul>
